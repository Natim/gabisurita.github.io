Who am I?
---------

Hi! I'm a last year computer engineering student at University of Campinas (Unicamp).
I'm currently working as an internship at Mozilla on Outreachy.
The project I'm most involved it's called Kinto, which is a REST HTTP database interface
with sharing and syncing capabilities.
My previous work experience involves hardware and machine learning.
My curriculum will soon be available at this page.
